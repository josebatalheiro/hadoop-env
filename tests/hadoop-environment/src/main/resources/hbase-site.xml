        <description>Comma separated list of servers in the
            ZooKeeper Quorum. For example,
            "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
            By default this is set to localhost for local
            and pseudo-distributed modes of operation. For
            a fully-distributed setup, this should be set
            to a full list of ZooKeeper quorum servers. If
            HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in hbase-env.sh this
            is the list of servers which we will
            start/stop ZooKeeper on.
